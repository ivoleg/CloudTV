| Term                | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Average             | The arithmetic mean of a collection of numbers. That is, letting *v*1, *v*2, ..., *v**n* denote *n* numbers, the average is defined as Σ*i* *v**i* */ n**.* For example, the average of the numbers 8.0, 7.0, and 8.5 is (8.0 + 7.0 + 8.5) / 3 = 23.5/3 = 7.833. |
| Dropped             | A score is said to be dropped when it is not included in subsequent calculations. For example, it many competitions it is common to drop the highest and lowest score. |
| Empty               | A collection is said to be empty of it does not contain any elements. |
| Ignored             | When a value is ignored it does not enter into the calculation in any way. For example, if missing values are ignored then the total of the numbers 8.0, Missing, and 7.0 is (8.0 + 7.0) = 15.0 and the average is 15.0 / 2 = 7.5. |
| Invalid Weight      | A weight that does not have an appropriate numeric value. Invalid weights may be handled differently in different situations. For example, they may be ignored or they may be treated as 1. |
| Missing Value/Score | A score that does not have a numeric value. Missing values/scores may be handled differently in different situations. For example, they may be ignored or they may be treated as 0. |
| Missing Weight      | A weight that does not have a numeric value. Missing weights may be handled differently in different situations. For example, they may be ignored or they may be treated as 1. |
| Position            | The diver’s body position. There are five traditional positions, Straight (A), Pike (B), Tuck (C), Free (D), and Fly (E). |
| Score               | A labeled numeric score for a competition of some kind (e.g., a sporting event, a talent show). The label is referred to as the **key** and the numeric score is referred to as the **value**. |
| Total               | The sum of a collection of numbers. That is, letting *v*1, *v*2, ..., *v**n* denote *n* numbers, the average is defined as Σ*i* *v**i* *.* For example, the total of the numbers 8.0, 7.0, and 8.5 is (8.0 + 7.0 + 8.5) = 23.5. |
| Unspecified Weight  | A weight is said to be unspecified for a particular key when there is no weight that corresponds to that key. For example, in a diving system, a degree of difficulty is a weight. If there is no degree of difficulty that corresponds to a particular dive then the degree of difficulty is said to be unspecified. |
| Weight              | A number that will be multiplied by another number. <br />For example, in a diving system, each dive has a degree of difficulty and the score on the dive is multiplied by its degree of difficulty. |
| Weighted Average    | Letting *v*1, *v*2, ..., *v**n* denote *n* numbers and *w*1, *w*2, ..., *w**n* denote corresponding weights, the weighted average is defined as Σ*i* (*w**i* *v**i*) */* Σ*i* *w**i**.* |
| Weighted Total      | Letting *v*1, *v*2, ..., *v**n* denote *n* numbers and *w*1, *w*2, ..., *w**n* denote corresponding weights, the weighted total is defined as Σ*i* *wi* *v**i**.* |
